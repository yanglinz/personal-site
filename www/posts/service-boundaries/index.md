Microservices architecture has been a rather hot topic for a few years now. I've
now worked for a few teams that has either started off on or transitioned to
this pattern, and over time I think I've become a skeptic.

While there's no shortage of blog posts or conference talks with titles along
the lines of "We migrated to a Microservices architecture and it's been
awesome!", I'd argue that it's only likely viable for a narrow context. But
until recently, I couldn't really articulate why I'd felt this skepticism. It's
always been tacit knowledge in my mind that for 90% of teams and companies,
fragmenting an application into little services will leave you in a worse off
state than before.

Last week, I was listening to
[an episode of Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/05/13/facebook-engineering-with-pete-hunt/)
with Pete Hunt about the engineering culture of Facebook, and he had great
nuggets of wisdom about services that finally crystallized my own thought that
has percolated for a while now in my head.

Micro-service architecture, despite how many times we label it as an
architectural decision, is first and foremost an organizational pattern that
then reinforces a system level architecture via
[Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law). And I think eager
adopters may never fully factor in the size and structure of their organization
into the consideration before adoption. It's primarily seen as the architectural
antidote that will increase agility™, but the cost and risk of adoption may be
brushed aside due to hype.

There are rarely anything in software engineering that can be categorized as a
good idea in all contexts, or conversely a terrible idea in all contexts. But I
do wish that as an industry, we're a little bit more critical about
understanding the root problems that we're addressing with a proposed solution,
and the nuance and context of what made it successful for others. For services,
it's much less about an architectural pattern, than it is about communication
patterns between humans and teams.

As time goes on, and your organizational structure and product evolves, you may
find that changing the boundaries of your services, restructuring teams, and
coordinating that effort will be a lot tougher than moving some files and
directory around in a Monolith. After all, the technical bits tend to be a lot
easier to wrangle than the people bits.
